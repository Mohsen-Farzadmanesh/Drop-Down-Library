### Hello EveryBody :)
Today I wrote a JavaScript code for one of my projects and said that it might be useful for someone, so I put it in GitHub :)

## How to make a drop down?

First you need to add the library to the project.
Just download the file **Dropdown.js** from here, put it in your project folder and attach it to your page with a script script

```
<script src="./Dropdown.js"></script>
```

Now add the drop down code anywhere on the page you like and change the text according to your needs, you can put as many options as you want and customize it with **css** :)
```
      <div class="select">
            <div class="front activator" id="activator">
                  <p class="text" id="drop-data">Drop Down</p>
                  <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="options" id="options">
                  <div class="option">
                        <p>option 1</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="option">
                        <p>option 2</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="option">
                        <p>option 3</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="option">
                        <p>option 4</p>
                  </div>
            </div>
      </div>
```
